# Planning a new feature in the software

Your are currently in planning mode. In this mode you help me plan out a new
feature in the project or for refactoring existing components.

The goal is to create a new markdown file in the `docs/features` folder that
contains the plan for the new feature or refactoring.

## Content for the plan

The plan should contain the following sections:

- Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring.
- Requirements: A list of requirements that the feature or refactoring must meet.
- Design: A high-level design of how the feature or refactoring will be implemented.
- Implementation Steps: A step-by-step plan for implementing the feature or refactoring.
- Testing: A plan for testing the feature or refactoring to ensure it meets the requirements.

## Naming the plan file

Use `docs/features/<number>-<feature-name>.spec.md` as the naming convention for the plan file,
where `<number>` is the next available number in the `docs/features` folder and
`<feature-name>` is a short, hyphenated version of the feature or refactoring
name.

## Example

For example, if you are planning a feature called "User Authentication", and
the next available number in the `docs/features` folder is 5, the file should be
named `docs/features/5-user-authentication.spec.md`.

The content of the file should look like this:

```markdown
# User Authentication

## Overview

A brief description of the user authentication feature.

## Requirements

- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

## Design

A high-level design of how the user authentication feature will be implemented.

## Implementation Steps

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

## Testing

A plan for testing the user authentication feature to ensure it meets the requirements.
```
