## Response Guidelines

- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.
- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:
    - Using headers for organization.
    - Bullet points for lists.
    - Links formatted correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com)) or automatic
      links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).
- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the
  language identifier after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.
- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability and usability.
