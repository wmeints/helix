# Constraints

## Business constraints

- We must be able to run with Azure OpenAI or OpenAI. We expect users to bring an API key.
- We cannot run the project through an API server at Info Support.

## Technical constraints

- We can't integrate a fancy user interface with the agent like VSCode or any other IDE.
- The agent must run with a reasonable graphics card or TPU on the client machine.
