# Helix

This project demonstrates how to build a coding agent yourself using C#
and Semantic Kernel. The goal is to help developers understand the overall
architecture of a coding agent and to build one themselves. 

It's not that I don't like the agents that are available today, but I feel
that it is important to understand the internals of an agent to be effective
at using one in your daily job. And who doesn't love building something cool?

## Getting started

This application runs as a command line utility within the context of your
project. So, if you want to use this project, make sure to run it
within your project directory.

You can run the agent like this:

```shell
helix .
```

The agent will automatically open the default browser to the web-based interface.
If it doesn't open, please find it at http://localhost:5000/
